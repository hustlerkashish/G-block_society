# Event Management System Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Event Fetching Issues
**Problem**: Events were not fetching properly from the API - the Events component was using mock data instead of real API calls.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `frontend/src/pages/Events.jsx` to use real API calls instead of mock data
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Implemented proper data fetching with `useEffect` hooks
- Added loading skeletons for better user experience

### 2. Admin Booking Tracking
**Problem**: Admin could not see how many bookings were done by which house and total revenue collection for events.

**Solution**:
- Created new `frontend/src/pages/AdminEvents.jsx` component with comprehensive analytics
- Added booking details table showing house numbers, resident names, attendees, amounts paid
- Implemented revenue tracking and analytics for each event
- Added expandable accordion view for detailed event information

### 3. Dashboard UI Improvements
**Problem**: Both admin and user dashboards needed better UI and functionality.
