# Hydration Error Fix

## üêõ Issue Description

The error occurs because we have a `<div>` (Chip component) nested inside a `<p>` tag (Typography component) in the ListItemText secondary prop. This is invalid HTML and causes React hydration errors.

**Error Message:**
```
In HTML, <div> cannot be a descendant of <p>.
This will cause a hydration error.
```

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

### Problem Location
The issue was in `frontend/src/pages/UserProfile.jsx` in the family members list where Typography components inside ListItemText secondary prop were rendering as `<p>` tags by default.

### Solution
Changed Typography components in the secondary text to use `component="div"`:

```javascript
// Before (causing hydration error)
<Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
  Age: {member.age} years
</Typography>

// After (fixed)
<Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary" component="div">
  Age: {member.age} years
</Typography>
```

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/UserProfile.jsx` - Fixed Typography components in family members list

### 1. Install Multer (Required for Profile Photo Upload)
